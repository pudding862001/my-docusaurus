In this chapter, we introduce **Python**, a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. We will cover the basic environment setup, syntax rules, and how to write your first script.

## 1. What is Python?



Python is a general-purpose programming language created by **Guido van Rossum** and first released in 1991. It is designed to emphasize code readability with its use of significant indentation.

* **Interpreted**: Python code is executed line-by-line by an interpreter, rather than being compiled into machine code all at once (like C or C++). This makes debugging and testing easier.
* **High-Level**: Python handles memory management and system details automatically, allowing developers to focus on logic rather than hardware.
* **Dynamically Typed**: You do not need to declare the data type of a variable explicitly; Python figures it out at runtime.

### Why Python?
* **Automation**: Widely used in Network Automation (Ansible, Netmiko) and Cloud Scripting (AWS Boto3).
* **Data Science**: The dominant language for AI, Machine Learning, and Data Analysis.
* **Web Development**: Powers backends using frameworks like Django and Flask.

## 2. Setting Up the Environment

To run Python, you typically need an **Interpreter** and an **IDE** (Integrated Development Environment).

* **Interpreter**: The engine that runs Python code (e.g., CPython). You can verify installation by typing `python --version` in your terminal.
* **IDE / Editor**:
    * **VS Code**: Highly recommended for its rich extension ecosystem.
    * **PyCharm**: A powerful IDE specifically for Python.
    * **Jupyter Notebook**: Great for data science and learning step-by-step.
