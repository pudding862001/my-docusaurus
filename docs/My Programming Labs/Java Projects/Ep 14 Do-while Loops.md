## Ep14 Do-While Loops

In this episode, we explore the **Do-While Loop**. This is a variant of the `while` loop with one key difference: it checks its condition at the **bottom** of the loop instead of the top.

### Key Takeaways:

* **Execute at least once**: Because the condition is checked after the code block runs, the code inside a `do-while` loop is guaranteed to execute at least one time, even if the condition is false.
* **Input Validation**: This loop is perfect for scenarios where you need to ask a user for input and then check if that input is valid. If it's not, you "do" it again.
* **`System.in.read()`**: A basic way to read character input from the keyboard. It returns the ASCII value of the character pressed.
* **The Semicolon `;`**: Unlike `while` or `for` loops, a `do-while` loop **must** end with a semicolon after the `while(condition);`.

### Episode 14 Code:

```java
import java.io.IOException;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {

        // 1. Basic Do-While Loop
        int bob = 35;
        do {
            System.out.println("Bob's current value: " + bob);
            bob++;
        } while (bob < 40); // Guaranteed to run once even if bob was 100

        // 2. Practical Example: User Menu & Input Validation
        char choice;
        do {
            System.out.println("\n--- Color Menu ---");
            System.out.println("1: Green");
            System.out.println("2: Blue");
            System.out.println("3: Red");
            System.out.println("4: Yellow");
            System.out.print("Choose a number (1-4): ");

            // Reads a single character from the console
            choice = (char) System.in.read();

            // Skip over the newline character generated by pressing 'Enter'
            // This is a common trick when using System.in.read()
            while (System.in.read() != '\n'); 

        } while (choice < '1' || choice > '4'); // Repeat if input is out of range

        // 3. Handling the Valid Choice
        switch(choice) {
            case '1':
                System.out.println("Success! You chose Green.");
                break;
            case '2':
                System.out.println("Success! You chose Blue.");
                break;
            case '3':
                System.out.println("Success! You chose Red.");
                break;
            case '4':
                System.out.println("Success! You chose Yellow.");
                break;
        }
    }
}
