# My Academic Background


## 🎓 College

### **National Chiao Tung University** | Department of Transportation Technology and Management
**[Sep. 2009 - Jun. 2013]**

### Core Courses: 
* **Object-Oriented Programming:** Developed a strong foundation in programming using C++ and Visual Basic, focusing on core OOP principles.
* **Data Structures:** Studied and implemented classic algorithmic problems, including Linked List manipulation, Backtracking (Rat in a Maze), and recursive logic (Tower of Hanoi).
* **Operating Systems:** Analyze the Critical Section problem and implement Mutex and Semaphore mechanisms to solve the Dining Philosophers Problem.
* **Transportation Information:** Utilized Dijkstra's Algorithm to perform shortest-path optimization within network models.

### Information and Management Program: 
* Completed a rigorous series of Information Management courses, including Management Information Systems (MIS), Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Database Management
* The curriculum depth and breadth are equivalent to a minor in Management Information Systems.

## 🎓 Graduate

### **National Tsing Hua University** | Department of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management
**[Sep. 2013 - Jun. 2015]**

### Core Courses: 
* **Stochastic Processes:** Explored the mathematical modeling of systems that evolve over time with inherent randomness. Such as Markov Chains, Poisson Processes, and Queuing Theory.
* **Mathematical Statistics:** Studied the theoretical foundations of statistics, focusing on probability distributions, parameter estimation, and hypothesis testing.
* **Soft Computing:** Studied nature-inspired computational methodologies designed to solve complex non-linear problems. Covered Fuzzy Logic, Neural Networks, and Evolutionary Algorithms (e.g., Genetic Algorithms).

### Focus Study:
* **Meta-heuristic Algorithms:** Specialized in algorithms including Genetic Algorithms (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Simplified Swarm Optimization (SSO).
* **Deteriorated Network Model:** Researched network models where transported goods lose value, quality, or quantity over time (deterioration effect).
* **Algorithms Programming (C++):** Utilized C++ to implement GA, PSO, and SSO algorithms for both standard and deteriorated network systems, seeking global optimization through thousands of iterations.

### Master's Thesis: Application of Simplified Swarm Optimization Algorithm in Deteriorated Supply Chain Network Problem 
* **Objective:** Optimized cargo distribution within a multi-tier (three-tier) supply chain network, specifically addressing the challenges of "deterioration" (where goods lose value or quality over time).
* **Methodology:** Implemented and refined the Simplified Swarm Optimization (SSO) algorithm, a metaheuristic approach, to solve complex NP-hard logistics and cost-minimization problems.
* **Key Results:** Successfully developed a mathematical model and an efficient algorithmic solution to minimize total operational costs while satisfying time and resource constraints in a dynamic network environment.
